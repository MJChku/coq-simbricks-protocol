# coq-simbricks-protocol

The general idea:
Following the week11 lecture on shallow embedding, we create a similar language for doing our project. 
The monard in our language accepts the "state" and returns the (value, state) pair. Here the "state" is a (heap, trace) pair. 

The trace will record a list of critical operations that the simbricks protocol has executed, and some important state like timestamps. So the trace will be a list of (event, timestamp) pair. Event is enum and timestamp is nat. 

Our small language allows us to execute some commands to simulate the process of the simbricks protocols (handling of messages etc). 

We write the main process loop defined in simbricks protocols with our small language. 

The process loop takes a trace assumed to be generated by other party involved in this protocol.  

We assume the other party is behaving normally (through defined properties on its trace, named "trace A"). 

We then verify some properties of the process loop itself by verifing the generated trace (named "trace B") given the "trace A".
